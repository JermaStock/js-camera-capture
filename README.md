# JS-Camera-Capture

Vanilla JS camera capture example, working on desktop and mobile based on navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia().

Designed as a basic user interface example for taking a picture and sending it to some server, here the [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) channel: [https://ntfy.sh/js-camera-capture](https://ntfy.sh/js-camera-capture)

There are two versions.

## 1) Modal Version 
**[Demo](https://do-me.github.io/js-camera-capture)**

For realistic use cases: `Activate Camera` opens a modal with the canvas. The buttons have some basic styling.

There is another version with an additional text input option: **[with-text-input](https://do-me.github.io/js-camera-capture/with-text-input)**

## 2) Simple Version
**[Demo](https://do-me.github.io/js-camera-capture/simple-version)**

This version displays the video stream canvas directly to the html body (which might be good for testing and simple stuff). Pretty much without CSS modifications.

## Options

If you'd like to activate the front camera on mobile as default (instead of the rear one) use the `facingMode: 'user'` instead of `facingMode: 'environment'`: 

```javascript
stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: 'user' } });
```

## Collaboration

PR's are very welcome, especially for enhancing the UI or adding more features. However, the codebase should be kept:
- simple
- small

I used one html file only as it's easier to move around and download but I'm open for separating it properly in html, js, css.
Feel free to create plugins or wrapper!

## To Do
- add camera switch for mobile phones
- add logic when user rotates phone - the canvas currently doesn't follow the 90Â° rotation which leads to a weird UX
